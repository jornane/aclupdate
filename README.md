ACL Update
=========

Keep Linux ACLs under control by synchronising them with an ACL file.
Take a look at ```demo.acl``` and create your own ACL file. Run ```aclupdate.py``` with your file as argument. It will then set ACLs on all elements mentioned in the ACL file

This project is currently in alpha stage. It may work for you. The format of the ACL file is subject to change. Careful when updating!
